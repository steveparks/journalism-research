# Journalism research project
I'm a former journalist who follows current journalism closely. It's fair to say we're living through a very intense era for news, with a very fragmented media to report on it. I'm curious to explore how stories emerge and develop.

## Data
At the moment, my research focuses on the BBC News website. I've been scraping the top ten headlines, and taking a screenshot, from the website on the hour every hour since 28th July 2020. This data is gathered on a fair use basis for research purposes.

That raw data is available in this github repo if other researchers are interested in accessing it.

## Questions
My research is then based on interrogating this raw data through a series of questions available at https://steveparks.github.io/journalism-research/

## Jupyter notebooks
My analysis is all done with python in Jupyter notebooks. Other researchers and journalists can examine and reproduce my research by loading these notebooks. Each notebook is linked from the page for each question, and all notebooks are stored together in the 'Jupyter Notebooks' folder in this github repo.

## Support
This is a personal research project and I'm afraid I'm not able to offer any support for the data or notebooks.

## Discussion
If you'd like to discuss any of the research, I'm active on Twitter as [@steveparks](https://twitter.com/steveparks)
